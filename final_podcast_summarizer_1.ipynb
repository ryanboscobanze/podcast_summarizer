            "[01:44.400 --> 01:48.320]  That's good for you because you invest in both public and private companies, yeah?\n",

            "[01:50.800 --> 01:51.360]  Yeah.\n",

            "[01:52.560 --> 01:54.400]  How do you price tariffs today?\n",
            "[01:55.200 --> 01:57.040]  So where do you think this ends up?\n",
            "[01:57.040 --> 01:58.880]  Obviously, there's a lot of back and forth.\n",
            "[01:58.880 --> 02:02.080]  And you know, everyone's trying to make a read on what the end game is.\n",
            "[02:02.080 --> 02:03.840]  What's your market take?\n",
            "[02:03.840 --> 02:06.960]  Is your making investments right now and where we end up on the tariff front?\n",
            "[02:07.760 --> 02:09.120]  It is a good question.\n",
            "[02:10.000 --> 02:10.960]  It's open.\n",
            "[02:10.960 --> 02:13.520]  We're going to see what happens with sectoral tariffs.\n",
            "[02:13.520 --> 02:15.040]  I think it's hard.\n",

            "[02:26.400 --> 02:28.960]  tariffs are not super relevant.\n",
            "[02:28.960 --> 02:32.000]  But you know, for the market, for the economy, they are relevant.\n",
            "[02:32.000 --> 02:34.400]  But for AI, there may be a little less relevant.\n",

            "[02:38.080 --> 02:40.240]  about the downsides of tariffs for\n",

            "[02:44.720 --> 02:45.600]  And ultimately,\n",
            "[02:46.640 --> 02:48.960]  don't we look at the tariff situation and say,\n",
            "[02:49.920 --> 02:54.160]  despite the shock and awe of the opening salvo,\n",
            "[02:54.320 --> 02:57.360]  it's quite a boring position.\n",
            "[02:57.360 --> 03:02.320]  Now, it just seems to be reciprocity and reasonable reciprocity at that.\n",
            "[03:02.320 --> 03:06.160]  Yeah, that's how we would sort of categorize the end game here.\n",
            "[03:06.160 --> 03:09.120]  I would say for everyone, but China, you know, it is,\n",
            "[03:09.120 --> 03:13.200]  and we've clearly reached some sort of deal with China,\n",
            "[03:13.200 --> 03:16.880]  you know, rare earths for H20s and MI308Xs.\n",
            "[03:17.840 --> 03:18.800]  But it's interesting.\n",
            "[03:18.800 --> 03:22.960]  And one of the trade deals that has been finalized is Vietnam.\n",
            "[03:23.040 --> 03:25.600]  And there's a special carve out for goods that were\n",

            "[03:28.320 --> 03:34.080]  So they are clearly focused on China more than almost in, you know, any other country,\n",
            "[03:34.080 --> 03:37.200]  rightly or wrongly. But yeah, and I do think there is,\n",
            "[03:39.520 --> 03:45.840]  you know, there was maybe three months where Trump said he did not care about the stock market.\n",

            "[03:53.280 --> 04:00.720]  So I think that that will be a dampening mechanism on tariff volatility.\n",
            "[04:02.640 --> 04:06.320]  But, you know, they pass the bill and he immediately went back to tariffs.\n",

            "[08:34.560 --> 08:35.680]  putting that aside.\n",
            "[08:35.680 --> 08:38.000]  It feels like the economy's in really great shape.\n",
            "[08:38.800 --> 08:40.720]  Chances of a rate cut has now flipped.\n",

            "[08:45.280 --> 08:46.960]  the favorite option was 25 bits.\n",
            "[08:46.960 --> 08:50.560]  So this idea that we're going to cut or the fed's going to cut,\n",
            "[08:50.560 --> 08:52.640]  that seems to be changing as well.\n",
            "[08:52.640 --> 08:57.120]  So your thoughts on the macro picture here?\n",
            "[08:57.120 --> 09:00.880]  So I'm not sure the firing of Jerome Powell\n",
            "[09:00.880 --> 09:04.880]  necessarily solves the US fiscal challenge,\n",
            "[09:04.880 --> 09:09.920]  which is rising interest rates on the long end of the Treasury curve.\n",
            "[09:10.560 --> 09:15.600]  So if you look at the 30-year Treasury yield over time,\n",
            "[09:15.600 --> 09:17.920]  and Nick maybe you could pull this up while I'm talking,\n",
            "[09:18.000 --> 09:22.800]  but as of today, we're at exactly 5% on the 30-year.\n",

            "[09:26.160 --> 09:30.080]  which is what the market is demanding the United States government pay\n",
            "[09:30.880 --> 09:36.560]  in order to be loaned the money to make the bill payments that the US government has to make every year,\n",
            "[09:37.440 --> 09:39.920]  is the highest it's been, the borrowing cost,\n",
            "[09:39.920 --> 09:43.920]  is the highest it's been since going all the way back to 2007 as of today.\n",
            "[09:44.880 --> 09:47.440]  And I think this is the real story for the United States.\n",

            "[09:50.720 --> 09:55.760]  The average interest rate we're paying on that debt today is 3.3%.\n",

            "[09:58.800 --> 10:04.160]  the Treasury Department has issued, to borrow the money that it is using and has used to pay all its bills.\n",
            "[10:05.200 --> 10:08.640]  And if you look at the 5% number, that's a 1.7% hike.\n",
            "[10:10.240 --> 10:14.160]  At 3.3%, which is the current average rate we're paying,\n",
            "[10:14.240 --> 10:17.840]  across $36 trillion, we have a run rate interest expense.\n",
            "[10:17.840 --> 10:23.360]  So just the money we're paying each year on the interest of the outstanding debt is $1.2 trillion a year.\n",
            "[10:24.400 --> 10:27.120]  And if this spikes up to 5% from 3.3,\n",
            "[10:27.680 --> 10:31.760]  we're talking about nearly $2 trillion a year in interest expense.\n",
            "[10:31.760 --> 10:35.200]  And that number is only going to get bigger as we borrow more money each year,\n",
            "[10:35.200 --> 10:37.040]  and the loan balance goes up.\n",
            "[10:37.040 --> 10:41.120]  The outstanding debt goes up because we are still running a deficit.\n",
            "[10:41.120 --> 10:42.960]  The government is spending more than it's making every year.\n",
            "[10:43.920 --> 10:49.520]  So the crisis that America faces is a more profound fiscal crisis,\n",
            "[10:49.520 --> 10:53.840]  where the rates that we're having to pay are a function of what the market is telling us.\n",
            "[10:53.840 --> 10:59.600]  The market does not want to loan the United States money over a 30-year period for less than 5% as of today.\n",
            "[11:00.560 --> 11:04.160]  And so making adjustments to the short end of the Treasury curve,\n",
            "[11:04.160 --> 11:07.600]  making overnight loans cheaper, which is what the Fed can do,\n",
            "[11:08.240 --> 11:12.480]  will stimulate the economy and make more money flow easily because now you'll be able to borrow\n",
            "[11:12.480 --> 11:16.800]  money overnight to do stuff like build a building, and then sell the building next week or next\n",
            "[11:16.800 --> 11:21.520]  month, or take out a car loan and pay it down and use your car to go drive for Uber and grow the\n",
            "[11:21.520 --> 11:26.800]  economy and other things. So the theory is that if we can drive rates down on the short end of\n",
            "[11:26.800 --> 11:30.560]  the curve, we'll grow the economy such that we'll be able to make those payments on the long end of\n",
            "[11:30.560 --> 11:36.480]  the curve. But there comes a point where, again, you're only going to be able to move the market\n",
            "[11:36.480 --> 11:42.400]  so much until the more important fiscal situations are going to be addressed, which is spending\n",
            "[11:43.120 --> 11:48.080]  taxation and some of the other key policy issues. So I think what the market is saying is it's not\n",
            "[11:48.080 --> 11:54.160]  as much about your own pal, and frankly, getting rid of a prudent individual may be more challenging\n",
            "[11:54.160 --> 11:57.760]  than it is beneficial when the real challenge is facing the United States need to be more\n",
            "[11:57.760 --> 12:00.880]  heartily addressed. So I think that's my kind of take on this whole topic.\n",
            "[12:00.880 --> 12:03.200]  I can't think. Yeah, go ahead, Gavin, build on it.\n",
            "[12:03.200 --> 12:07.520]  So point number one, the 30-year has gone up since pal started cutting rates.\n",
            "[12:08.400 --> 12:13.120]  So that is just empirical proof that what David is saying, I think, is right.\n",
            "[12:13.840 --> 12:20.960]  And second, the deficit has been a feature of American politics,\n",
            "[12:20.960 --> 12:29.040]  stated back to Ross Perot's 1992 presidential run. But it never ended third party run.\n",
            "[12:29.040 --> 12:34.640]  It's a third party run. Here we go. But yes, but the deficit never really mattered,\n",
            "[12:35.120 --> 12:40.560]  because interest rates kept going down, such that even has our debt grew.\n",
            "[12:41.120 --> 12:46.720]  Interest expense has kind of a percentage of the government's budget stayed relatively low.\n",
            "[12:47.360 --> 12:54.320]  Now that rates have gone up and don't seem like they're going down anytime soon,\n",
            "[12:54.320 --> 13:01.760]  the deficit does matter and it really matters. And you can kind of run a couple of scenarios,\n",
            "[13:01.760 --> 13:08.000]  but like pick your metric. If the deficit kind of continues at current levels,\n",
            "[13:08.720 --> 13:14.960]  and we were to refinance the debt at the prices that David was talking about,\n",
            "[13:16.960 --> 13:21.600]  it's only a few years before spending on interest is significantly larger than\n",
            "[13:21.600 --> 13:26.320]  spending on Medicare and Medicaid, our social security, our the military. So pick something\n",
            "[13:26.320 --> 13:33.360]  you care about, but our current course in speed, it's in the not too distant future where\n",
            "[13:33.360 --> 13:38.720]  interest expense is the biggest line item for the government. And that is not healthy. And that's\n",
            "[13:38.720 --> 13:44.480]  why the deficit finally matters is just that rates are higher. But the great thing is, as there is\n",
            "[13:44.480 --> 13:51.280]  a virtuous cycle here, as you close the deficit, rates should theoretically come down.\n",
            "[13:51.760 --> 13:58.400]  And then those both feed on each other to kind of help the problem. And it is possible.\n",
            "[13:58.400 --> 14:05.280]  There's no silver bullet here, but some combination of slowing government spending, extra revenue,\n",
            "[14:05.280 --> 14:10.720]  and tariffs are effectively, we've never had a consumption tax here in America,\n",
            "[14:11.680 --> 14:14.800]  which I think is a good thing because consumption taxes are very regressive.\n",
            "[14:14.960 --> 14:21.520]  But the reality is, like even when Obama controlled the House, the Senate, and was the most\n",
            "[14:21.520 --> 14:26.720]  popular Democratic president of our lifetime, I don't think federal government tax receipts\n",
            "[14:26.720 --> 14:31.520]  has a percentage of GDP got above 18, 19%. So that's kind of the ceiling.\n",
            "[14:33.200 --> 14:39.360]  And it for income taxes alone. And tariffs are really just a consumption tax that kind of\n",
            "[14:39.360 --> 14:44.080]  incensed domestic manufacturing. I mean, there's all sorts of reasons. They're bad ideas.\n",
            "[14:44.800 --> 14:50.320]  David Ricardo, the theory of comparative advantage, 100% correct. Free trade is a good thing.\n",
            "[14:52.080 --> 14:57.440]  But introducing some sort of a consumption tax, growing the economy a little bit faster through\n",
            "[14:57.440 --> 15:03.600]  deregulation, and slowing government spending, I think there is a way out of this for America.\n",
            "[15:04.400 --> 15:08.640]  But it's important to find the way because the deficit finally does matter. After\n",
            "[15:08.640 --> 15:13.600]  really never mattering in my political lifetime. It is interesting. We've never had to worry about\n",
            "[15:13.600 --> 15:18.800]  our debt. It was always manageable because it wasn't that large. And even when it got large,\n",
            "[15:18.800 --> 15:23.360]  it wasn't compared to GDP because the country was doing so well. We had the PC revolution.\n",
            "[15:23.360 --> 15:27.440]  We had the internet boom. I mean, we've had boom after boom after boom in efficiency that we've\n",
            "[15:27.440 --> 15:32.400]  led the world. And these companies like Google or Apple take over the world and all those tax\n",
            "[15:32.400 --> 15:38.320]  receipts and income comes into our country. That does sort of make you not look at it. I guess\n",
            "[15:38.320 --> 15:43.440]  I haven't talked to you, Gavin, and not to make this super political. But both parties have proven\n",
            "[15:43.440 --> 15:49.120]  that they have no interest historically and in the current one with cutting spending. It's just\n",
            "[15:49.120 --> 15:53.680]  the nature of it. So we can sit here, whether you're a Biden-Fantrum fan, put it all aside.\n",
            "[15:54.400 --> 15:59.920]  Both parties love spending and they're not stopping. One of our friends has proposed, hey, maybe in\n",
            "[15:59.920 --> 16:05.360]  the midterms, we have a couple of these house positions, a couple of senators, maybe we try to\n",
            "[16:05.360 --> 16:09.600]  flip them and create a new party that cares about this issue. What are your thoughts, probably,\n",
            "[16:09.600 --> 16:16.480]  on that? A couple of more Joe Manchin types were in the House, the Senate. Could this country\n",
            "[16:17.200 --> 16:24.480]  maybe start to make this the deciding issue? And maybe could we see some movement on the other\n",
            "[16:24.480 --> 16:28.720]  two parties, some pressure on them by a third party, an America party, perhaps?\n",
            "[16:29.680 --> 16:36.080]  Yeah, well, I think a few things. I do think there is room for a much more centrist party in America.\n",
            "[16:37.520 --> 16:46.400]  You know, the way the primaries work, it leads to more maybe extreme candidates than anyone would\n",
            "[16:46.400 --> 16:52.800]  actually want, you know, being each party's candidate. So I think a third party would be helpful.\n",
            "[16:53.760 --> 16:59.200]  You know, and I think there's plenty of room for a party that is, you know, kind of a\n",
            "[17:00.400 --> 17:08.800]  fiscally conservative, reasonably socially liberal, pro-American energy production,\n",

            "[17:16.640 --> 17:20.720]  So I think there's room for that and I think it is right that if you just target a few races,\n",
            "[17:20.720 --> 17:25.200]  you can have a big impact. But I would just say, yeah, well, humbly, I think the American party is\n",
            "[17:25.200 --> 17:32.640]  a great idea. I just don't know that it is the highest and best use of Elon's talents at this moment\n",
            "[17:32.640 --> 17:41.200]  in time with what's happening with AI. And just, you know, to the extent Elon is a friend of the pod,\n",

            "[18:00.480 --> 18:07.680]  a distraction away from the highest priority work that should be done. I mean, it's a political\n",
            "[18:07.680 --> 18:11.600]  stuff unique. And then his point is you and the political stuff, just like it was with Twitter,\n",
            "[18:12.240 --> 18:17.040]  is that it's existential to society and civilization and our ability to function and to do,\n",

            "[18:31.440 --> 18:38.640]  kind of exceptional has a CEO is the perfectionism, the drive, and you know, politics is not a game\n",
            "[18:38.640 --> 18:45.280]  of perfection. It's a game of compromise. So I am sure if he sets his mind to the America party,\n",
            "[18:45.280 --> 18:50.880]  that he will succeed, but I think there are other things for him to focus on. And, you know,\n",

            "[19:02.880 --> 19:10.880]  So I think he would succeed. I just think that there are other things that maybe a higher calling\n",
            "[19:10.880 --> 19:17.440]  for him. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and the cost of being away from his businesses this last time around,\n",
            "[19:18.160 --> 19:24.800]  as he said very publicly was severe. It was intense and he's had to really regroup, but we got this\n",

            "[19:45.680 --> 19:53.200]  super intelligent. So where do we sit on the language models today, Gavin and Elon's recent,\n",
            "[19:55.200 --> 20:01.280]  let's just call it what it is. I mean, incredibly dominant release of Grog four. I don't think\n",
            "[20:01.280 --> 20:05.920]  people expected that. They didn't expect him to be able to leapfrog everybody. And let's be\n",
            "[20:05.920 --> 20:11.840]  honest, people are leapfrogging each other every four to six months. So I fully expect Gemini will\n",

            "[20:16.720 --> 20:21.840]  impressive, right? I'll say this is the biggest leapfrog we've seen in quite some time. And I think\n",

            "[20:41.440 --> 20:47.360]  not seen the questions before. And it did roughly twice as good as, you know, the state of our Google\n",

            "[21:02.800 --> 21:08.320]  So this is incredible progress. And I think it's worth mentioning this model was trained on\n",
            "[21:08.320 --> 21:14.640]  Hopper. So this model is probably about as far as you can take the last generation of Nvidia GPUs.\n",

            "[21:32.880 --> 21:38.960]  artificial general intelligence will create a lot of economic value. But, you know, and, you know,\n",

            "[22:10.640 --> 22:15.200]  where we are right now in this journey. Because I think these terms are all getting muddled together.\n",

            "[22:59.280 --> 23:04.800]  interesting questions is what will the economic returns to superintelligence be? And they're\n",
            "[23:04.800 --> 23:10.000]  definitely unknowable because we have never seen superintelligence before. If is humans,\n",

            "[23:17.760 --> 23:22.960]  then maybe the economic returns to superintelligence won't be that high. But if superintelligence is\n",
            "[23:22.960 --> 23:27.600]  cheering cancer and inventing warp drives, then the returns are going to be really, really high.\n",

            "[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  to stop it and that didn't happen like we've actually now moved forward geniuses about to become law\n",
