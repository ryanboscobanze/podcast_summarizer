            "[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  It was great.\n",
            "[02:15.000 --> 02:16.720]  I think that's Kila turned out fantastic.\n",
            "[02:16.720 --> 02:21.240]  Just to Kila has been, I mean, you guys realize when we first started talking about this,\n",
            "[02:21.240 --> 02:26.080]  this was like two and a half, almost three years ago, when we first started talking about\n",
            "[02:26.080 --> 02:27.080]  this.\n",
            "[02:27.080 --> 02:29.120]  And it is finally here.\n",
            "[02:29.120 --> 02:34.240]  It took forever to get through this kind of design development process.\n",
            "[02:34.240 --> 02:35.560]  But man, I think it turned out great.\n",
            "[02:35.560 --> 02:36.560]  I thought it was awesome.\n",
            "[02:36.560 --> 02:41.240]  Everybody at the party was surprised by how good it was because they thought that, I\n",
            "[02:41.240 --> 02:45.040]  don't know, we were just doing this as a gimmick or something, but we actually put it in\n",
            "[02:45.040 --> 02:46.040]  the time to make it great.\n",
            "[02:46.160 --> 02:47.040]  A lot of time.\n",
            "[02:47.040 --> 02:48.040]  A lot of time.\n",
            "[02:48.040 --> 02:54.640]  So, talk a little bit about the sourcing because I think that sourcing was very important.\n",
            "[02:54.640 --> 02:56.960]  Well we went down to Kila, Mexico.\n",
            "[02:56.960 --> 03:01.640]  There's only one part of Mexico that's even allowed to be called Kila.\n",
            "[03:01.640 --> 03:09.200]  And we found a distillery that had been aging some agave in American oak whiskey barrels\n",
            "[03:09.200 --> 03:11.040]  for five years.\n",
            "[03:11.040 --> 03:13.880]  And normally extra on Yejo is eight for three years.\n",
            "[03:13.880 --> 03:19.120]  So it was pretty rare to find a cache of five year age.\n",
            "[03:19.120 --> 03:20.400]  And so we basically bought it all.\n",
            "[03:20.400 --> 03:22.280]  But there's only enough for 7,500 bottles.\n",
            "[03:22.280 --> 03:23.760]  So that's what we did.\n",
            "[03:23.760 --> 03:29.160]  But this is not about creating some large new Kila label.\n",
            "[03:29.160 --> 03:32.600]  This is more about creating something that we ourselves like.\n",
            "[03:32.600 --> 03:33.600]  And that's what we did.\n",
            "[03:33.600 --> 03:34.600]  Sort of a small batch product.\n",
            "[03:34.600 --> 03:39.000]  I mean, the money's not going to change anyone's life, except maybe yours.\n",
            "[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  That's a little bit.\n",
            "[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  I don't know.\n",
            "[03:42.000 --> 03:43.280]  I'm getting another record today.\n",
            "[03:43.280 --> 03:46.480]  So over past 88, you guys are all.\n",
            "[03:46.480 --> 03:48.080]  I don't have to be here anymore.\n",
            "[03:48.080 --> 03:49.080]  Oh my God.\n",
            "[03:49.080 --> 03:50.560]  But look, we do things because they're fun.\n",
            "[03:50.560 --> 03:52.280]  And it was fun to create this here.\n",
            "[03:52.280 --> 03:53.280]  I've got the.\n",
            "[03:53.280 --> 03:54.280]  It is fun.\n",
            "[03:54.280 --> 03:55.280]  It was really fun.\n",
            "[03:55.280 --> 03:56.280]  Well, look at this thing.\n",
            "[03:56.280 --> 03:59.160]  I mean, beautiful box slides open.\n",
            "[03:59.160 --> 04:01.480]  It's backlit in the box.\n",
            "[04:01.480 --> 04:02.480]  So good.\n",
            "[04:02.480 --> 04:03.880]  That out of the box experience is just amazing.\n",
            "[04:03.880 --> 04:05.680]  Yeah, it's a great unboxing.\n",
            "[04:05.680 --> 04:06.760]  Steve Jobs would be proud.\n",
            "[04:06.760 --> 04:09.000]  Tell us about the bottle design.\n",
            "[04:09.000 --> 04:10.480]  That was a lot of works.\n",
            "[04:10.600 --> 04:13.920]  I think this probably took an extra six months to get this right.\n",
            "[04:13.920 --> 04:19.080]  If I'm if I'm required correctly on the schedule, this is super complicated to execute.\n",
            "[04:19.080 --> 04:22.560]  Well, the bottle is designed after a stack of poker chips.\n",
            "[04:22.560 --> 04:25.200]  And so you can see the chips are stacked and there are a jar.\n",
            "[04:25.200 --> 04:28.160]  So it's like highly it's a lot of texture here.\n",
            "[04:28.160 --> 04:29.160]  It's made with glass.\n",
            "[04:29.160 --> 04:35.320]  And then there's these black chip accents that are actually painted onto the bottle perfectly.\n",
            "[04:35.320 --> 04:37.760]  So this took a lot to get right.\n",
            "[04:37.760 --> 04:42.360]  And then we went through a lot of prototypes to get this and it just looks amazing.\n",
            "[04:42.360 --> 04:43.360]  All right.\n",
            "[04:43.360 --> 04:44.360]  There you have it.\n",
            "[04:44.360 --> 04:48.560]  Folks, the all in tequila has promised it's finally available on our website.\n",
            "[04:48.560 --> 04:52.840]  So if you go to tequila dot all in dot com, you can now buy it.\n",
            "[04:52.840 --> 04:54.440]  There's only 7500 bottles.\n",
            "[04:54.440 --> 04:58.840]  I think we're only going to sell 6,000 because we're going to keep the rest for our personal\n",
            "[04:58.840 --> 04:59.840]  status.\n",
            "[04:59.840 --> 05:00.840]  We sold a good chunk already.\n",
            "[05:00.840 --> 05:02.240]  Like I think we're so they're going really fast.\n",
            "[05:02.240 --> 05:04.200]  We just opened up the website.\n",
            "[05:04.200 --> 05:07.560]  Previously, they were only available to people who had attended the all in summit.\n",
            "[05:07.560 --> 05:09.480]  They could pre-order it and reserve.\n",
            "[05:09.480 --> 05:10.880]  But now the website is open.\n",
            "[05:10.880 --> 05:11.880]  Oh, wow.\n",
            "[05:11.880 --> 05:12.880]  Beautiful.\n",
            "[05:12.880 --> 05:13.880]  It is.\n",
            "[05:13.880 --> 05:14.880]  Okay.\n",
            "[05:14.880 --> 05:15.880]  There you go.\n",
            "[05:15.880 --> 05:17.200]  What are your bottle limit to two?\n",
            "[05:17.200 --> 05:18.200]  And go ahead.\n",
            "[05:18.200 --> 05:20.440]  So this is, you know, this is not a cheap product.\n",
            "[05:20.440 --> 05:25.440]  But you know, if you look at the, the pure competitor for this product is the Clause's\n",
            "[05:25.440 --> 05:29.920]  Ultra, which I think sells at $1,700 a bottle.\n",
            "[05:29.920 --> 05:32.480]  Although sometimes I've seen itself as much as 3,000 a bottle.\n",
            "[05:32.480 --> 05:34.400]  So we're price competitively with that.\n",
            "[05:34.400 --> 05:35.400]  There you go.\n",
            "[05:35.400 --> 05:40.080]  You have those boxes and when you open it up, the lights up and you can recharge it.\n",
            "[05:40.080 --> 05:41.080]  So it's a keepsake, right?\n",
            "[05:41.080 --> 05:46.040]  There's a charging port in the box so that it never runs out of the battery to power\n",
            "[05:46.040 --> 05:47.040]  the light.\n",
            "[05:47.040 --> 05:48.040]  So genius.\n",
            "[05:48.040 --> 05:49.040]  So genius.\n",
            "[05:49.040 --> 05:50.040]  I love that little touch.\n",
            "[05:50.040 --> 05:51.040]  All right, folks.\n",
            "[05:51.040 --> 05:53.040]  There's tons in the new, look at this.\n",
            "[05:53.040 --> 05:54.040]  I'm sorry.\n",
            "[05:54.040 --> 05:58.880]  I mean, before we get to World War Three, let's get to Room, sir.\n",
            "[05:58.880 --> 05:59.880]  I said the ****.\n",
            "[05:59.880 --> 06:00.880]  Beep that out.\n",
            "[06:00.960 --> 06:04.840]  Samantha, do you want a side of caviar with your besties all in tequila?\n",
            "[06:06.040 --> 06:08.560]  Listen, being an elitist, guys, is very hard.\n",
            "[06:08.560 --> 06:10.240]  That's what I was tweeting how stressful it is.\n",
            "[06:10.240 --> 06:14.920]  Somebody was saying that we weren't living up to our job as being the elite.\n",
            "[06:14.920 --> 06:15.920]  Huh.\n",
            "[06:15.920 --> 06:18.400]  And I was like, man, this is, it's really stressful being an elite.\n",
            "[06:18.400 --> 06:20.120]  You know, we need, we need a drink.\n",
            "[06:20.120 --> 06:21.120]  Absolutely.\n",
            "[06:21.120 --> 06:22.120]  I'll take a double.\n",
            "[06:22.120 --> 06:23.120]  You have no idea.\n",

            "[08:02.840 --> 08:06.760]  Israel doesn't have them and that's the reason we're given of why we were pulled into\n",
            "[08:06.760 --> 08:10.600]  this is because we're the only people in the world who could have taken these out.\n",

            "[08:26.920 --> 08:31.520]  I think in this case is going through a ventilation shaft and it doesn't immediately go off.\n",

            "[08:35.160 --> 08:36.640]  This looks like a test to me.\n",
            "[08:36.640 --> 08:37.760]  This is just demonstrating it.\n",
            "[08:37.760 --> 08:38.760]  This is a demonstration.\n",
            "[08:38.760 --> 08:39.760]  This is a demonstration.\n",

            "[08:46.440 --> 08:49.720]  Obviously we're going for things underground.\n",
            "[08:49.720 --> 08:56.880]  Then shockingly, Iran did a, I don't know what you call this, a ceremonial response,\n",
            "[08:56.880 --> 09:00.040]  sacs where they sent some missiles to one of our bases in Qatar.\n",
            "[09:00.040 --> 09:01.680]  They gave us a ton of notice.\n",
            "[09:01.680 --> 09:03.640]  None of them landed.\n",
            "[09:03.640 --> 09:09.120]  And then both countries have been bombing each other a little bit after Trump said he negotiated\n",
            "[09:09.120 --> 09:14.040]  a ceasefire which made our president a little bit upset.\n",
            "[09:14.040 --> 09:19.680]  Here's the clip of the president not dropping a moab, but dropping an F-bomb.\n",
            "[09:19.680 --> 09:23.680]  Israel as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped the load of bombs\n",
            "[09:23.680 --> 09:26.040]  the likes of which I've never seen before.\n",
            "[09:26.040 --> 09:27.800]  The biggest load that we've seen.\n",
            "[09:27.800 --> 09:29.640]  I'm not happy with Israel.\n",
            "[09:29.640 --> 09:34.320]  You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour\n",
            "[09:34.320 --> 09:36.160]  and just drop everything you have on them.\n",
            "[09:36.160 --> 09:37.800]  So I'm not happy with them.\n",
            "[09:37.800 --> 09:39.440]  I'm not happy with Iran either.\n",
            "[09:39.440 --> 09:45.240]  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't\n",
            "[09:45.240 --> 09:46.840]  know what the fuck they're doing.\n",
            "[09:46.840 --> 09:47.840]  Do you understand that?\n",
            "[09:48.840 --> 09:49.840]  What?\n",
            "[09:49.840 --> 09:51.440]  Trump is not happy.\n",
            "[09:51.440 --> 09:52.440]  He did the lean in.\n",
            "[09:52.440 --> 09:55.040]  You notice the lean in their sacks when he dropped the F-bomb?\n",
            "[09:55.040 --> 10:01.480]  Well, in fairness, President Trump's not the first president to drop an F-bomb in frustration\n",
            "[10:01.480 --> 10:03.760]  with Netanyahu.\n",
            "[10:03.760 --> 10:09.640]  It was reported back in the 90s that Bill Clinton, when he had to deal with Netanyahu,\n",
            "[10:09.640 --> 10:15.800]  was being very obstinate and was basically rejecting all of Clinton's and treaties and\n",
            "[10:15.800 --> 10:16.800]  plans.\n",
            "[10:16.800 --> 10:20.840]  And his reporter has said, who's the fucking superpower here, you know, in frustration?\n",
            "[10:20.840 --> 10:26.880]  So this is not the first time that an American president has gotten frustrated with Netanyahu.\n",
            "[10:26.880 --> 10:30.880]  But I think people reacted quite well to that on the whole because it showed that President\n",
            "[10:30.880 --> 10:32.640]  Trump was willing to choose.\n",
            "[10:32.640 --> 10:33.640]  He cares.\n",
            "[10:33.640 --> 10:37.480]  Well, first of all, he negotiated this ceasefire, which was amazing.\n",
            "[10:37.480 --> 10:42.640]  Then what happens is that there was this deadline and it was like in a fight where they\n",
            "[10:42.640 --> 10:45.440]  ring the bell and the fighters keep slugging with each other.\n",
            "[10:45.440 --> 10:46.440]  Yeah.\n",
            "[10:46.440 --> 10:49.360]  It's like they both want to get a few extra hits in.\n",
            "[10:49.360 --> 10:52.800]  And that's what that's, yeah, they got some last looks in.\n",
            "[10:52.800 --> 10:56.000]  But President Trump negotiated the ceasefire, which was extraordinary.\n",
            "[10:56.000 --> 10:59.760]  And then he's willing to reprimand Israel for basically violating the ceasefire too,\n",
            "[10:59.760 --> 11:01.840]  which you have to do if you want to enforce it.\n",
            "[11:01.840 --> 11:03.800]  So I think that's basically what happened there.\n",
            "[11:03.800 --> 11:08.200]  Now you sacks, I'm sure the audience wants to challenge you on this.\n",
            "[11:08.200 --> 11:12.280]  You were, hey, Trump is a never getting involved in forever wars.\n",
            "[11:12.280 --> 11:15.280]  Obviously, it looks like this might not be a forever war, which would be fantastic if\n",
            "[11:15.280 --> 11:17.760]  that turns out to be the case.\n",
            "[11:17.760 --> 11:22.280]  And you were saying, hey, the reason to vote for Trump is he won't get us into another\n",
            "[11:22.280 --> 11:23.280]  war.\n",
            "[11:23.280 --> 11:24.360]  And here we go.\n",
            "[11:24.360 --> 11:30.280]  And obviously Tucker Halsey, there's a number of people who are, did not want to do this.\n",
            "[11:30.280 --> 11:31.560]  And you were one of them.\n",
            "[11:31.560 --> 11:37.400]  So how do you reconcile all of this as somebody who did not want to see us do this?\n",
            "[11:37.400 --> 11:38.400]  President Trump accomplished that.\n",
            "[11:38.400 --> 11:39.400]  We're not in a forever war.\n",
            "[11:39.400 --> 11:41.400]  We're not in a war with Iran.\n",
            "[11:41.400 --> 11:45.880]  If you look at Mark Levin today, he's apoplectic because he and people like him were advocating\n",
            "[11:45.880 --> 11:47.920]  for regime change war.\n",
            "[11:47.920 --> 11:52.160]  And they felt like this was the perfect opportunity to drag the United States into such a war.\n",
            "[11:52.160 --> 11:55.760]  And President Trump resisted that and said negotiated a ceasefire.\n",
            "[11:55.760 --> 11:59.760]  So it seems to me that he lived up to exactly his promises on this.\n",
            "[11:59.760 --> 12:04.440]  Look, I think President Trump had to thread a very difficult needle here.\n",
            "[12:04.440 --> 12:09.800]  If you look at polling, vast majority of the American population believe in two things.\n",
            "[12:09.800 --> 12:14.320]  Number one, they don't want Iran getting a nuclear weapon by like 80 something percent.\n",
            "[12:14.320 --> 12:18.440]  They also by 80 something percent don't want to get dragged into a new forever war in\n",
            "[12:18.440 --> 12:19.680]  the Middle East, right?\n",
            "[12:19.680 --> 12:23.720]  They don't want to be in a long, protracted war with Iran.\n",
            "[12:23.720 --> 12:26.440]  President Trump managed to accomplish both those objectives.\n",
            "[12:26.440 --> 12:32.200]  He took out the Iranian nuclear sites in these highly precise targeted strikes, but he\n",
            "[12:32.200 --> 12:35.480]  did not get dragged into a new Middle Eastern war.\n",
            "[12:35.480 --> 12:41.040]  And in fact, he negotiated a ceasefire and at least end to the war right now between Israel\n",
            "[12:41.040 --> 12:42.040]  and Iran.\n",
            "[12:42.040 --> 12:44.600]  I think there's very few leaders who could have threaded this needle.\n",
            "[12:44.600 --> 12:47.920]  Imagine if Kamla Harris were president, just do the counterfactual, which she have had\n",
            "[12:47.920 --> 12:54.200]  the situational awareness to realize that when the Iranian struck at our base in Qatar,\n",
            "[12:54.200 --> 12:58.680]  that it was performative, that it was telegraphed, and that it was meant to basically be for\n",
            "[12:58.680 --> 13:03.280]  domestic consumption and end the war, she might have escalated it.\n",
            "[13:03.280 --> 13:08.080]  Certainly, a lot of the Neocons who were on social media were saying, this is our chance,\n",
            "[13:08.080 --> 13:09.080]  right?\n",
            "[13:09.080 --> 13:13.800]  When the Iranians engaged in that performative hit on Qatar, they were saying, we got\n",
            "[13:13.800 --> 13:17.840]  to escalate, we got to basically bomb all of Iran now and get into a big war.\n",
            "[13:17.840 --> 13:22.000]  And Trump hit the overall awareness of the situation to avoid that.\n",
            "[13:22.000 --> 13:26.040]  And this goes back to his experience with Salamani back in the first Trump administration.\n",
            "[13:26.040 --> 13:30.080]  The Iranians did the same thing where they fired some missiles at American bases, but\n",
            "[13:30.080 --> 13:31.400]  they were telegraphed.\n",
            "[13:31.400 --> 13:33.120]  We were told in advance that they were coming.\n",
            "[13:33.120 --> 13:34.440]  They were easy to avoid.\n",
            "[13:34.440 --> 13:36.080]  No Americans got harmed.\n",
            "[13:36.080 --> 13:38.720]  And then Trump ended the conflict there.\n",
            "[13:38.720 --> 13:43.200]  And I think that a lot of presidents might have gotten sucked in to a new Middle Eastern\n",
            "[13:43.200 --> 13:44.200]  war.\n",
            "[13:44.200 --> 13:46.200]  Tremoth, let me pull you in here.\n",
            "[13:46.200 --> 13:51.800]  Obviously, little cognitive dissonance folks didn't want to go to war, but we don't want\n",
            "[13:51.800 --> 13:55.200]  WMDs in the hands of Iran.\n",
            "[13:55.200 --> 13:56.680]  How do you reconcile all of this?\n",
            "[13:56.680 --> 13:58.880]  Is the outcome make it okay?\n",
            "[13:58.880 --> 14:01.840]  In your mind, or would you rather see me not get involved in this?\n",
            "[14:01.840 --> 14:03.480]  Can I up level this slightly?\n",
            "[14:03.480 --> 14:11.240]  I think that this has been probably the most important week.\n",
            "[14:11.240 --> 14:18.600]  And I would almost say most important few months in U.S. politics in 30 or 40 years.\n",
            "[14:18.600 --> 14:21.880]  And the reason is that it starts to converge.\n",
            "[14:21.880 --> 14:25.880]  A bunch of things together that I think are really worth putting on the table.\n",
            "[14:25.880 --> 14:32.880]  So from my perspective, I think what President Trump has done is almost single-handedly bring\n",
            "[14:32.880 --> 14:37.600]  back the United States as the global superpower.\n",
            "[14:37.600 --> 14:39.920]  And I would put that in all caps.\n",
            "[14:39.920 --> 14:41.600]  So what does it mean to be a superpower?\n",
            "[14:41.600 --> 14:46.040]  I've said this several times, but just to be slightly redundant.\n",
            "[14:46.040 --> 14:51.440]  In order to be a superpower, I think you need to have three things, but they work in a hierarchy.\n",
            "[14:51.440 --> 14:54.600]  The first is that you need to have technical supremacy.\n",
            "[14:54.600 --> 15:00.600]  And then from that technological supremacy, you need to establish and project economic\n",
            "[15:00.600 --> 15:04.240]  supremacy and military supremacy.\n",
            "[15:04.240 --> 15:08.540]  So if you look at the first one, you saw a tactical demonstration of technological supremacy\n",
            "[15:08.540 --> 15:10.200]  with the B2 bombers.\n",
            "[15:10.200 --> 15:14.960]  But taking a more general step back, if you look at the largest companies in the world,\n",
            "[15:14.960 --> 15:18.640]  who are the ones that are actually driving the world forward?\n",
            "[15:18.640 --> 15:20.240]  These are all American companies.\n",
            "[15:20.240 --> 15:27.920]  I think these last few months, you've seen America firing on all cylinders technologically.\n",
            "[15:27.920 --> 15:32.200]  Economically, at the same time, you now have the stock market back at all time highs, you\n",
            "[15:32.200 --> 15:37.360]  have interest rates incredibly starting to compress even in the absence of the Federal\n",
            "[15:37.360 --> 15:39.980]  Reserve willing to act on data.\n",
            "[15:39.980 --> 15:42.880]  So you're projecting economic supremacy.\n",
            "[15:42.880 --> 15:47.400]  And then these last few weeks, frankly, have been a pretty clear-cut case of military\n",
            "[15:47.400 --> 15:48.400]  supremacy.\n",
            "[15:48.400 --> 15:53.600]  So I think what's pretty simple now is like the US is essentially telling the world our\n",
            "[15:53.600 --> 15:56.320]  words, carry weight again.\n",
            "[15:56.320 --> 15:58.760]  We're going to shape the global order.\n",
            "[15:58.760 --> 16:04.160]  Countries will now have to calibrate their actions around what the US is willing to tolerate\n",
            "[16:04.160 --> 16:06.560]  and what it isn't willing to tolerate.\n",
            "[16:06.560 --> 16:11.680]  And in the case of Iran, the President made those lines, I think, really crystal clear.\n",
            "[16:11.680 --> 16:15.480]  He warned them 100 times where the line was.\n",
            "[16:15.480 --> 16:16.680]  And he was clear.\n",
            "[16:16.680 --> 16:18.160]  You cannot build nuclear weapons.\n",
            "[16:18.160 --> 16:24.080]  And when the line was crossed, then look, I think the CNNs of the world wanted to debate\n",
            "[16:24.080 --> 16:25.400]  that the line wasn't crossed.\n",
            "[16:25.400 --> 16:28.240]  All I can tell you is I don't know because I don't have access to the intel.\n",
            "[16:28.240 --> 16:33.840]  I believe what he and Tulsi Gabbard and JD Vance and Marco Rubio and Pete Heggs are\n",
            "[16:33.840 --> 16:36.920]  the same is that they crossed the line.\n",
            "[16:36.920 --> 16:41.880]  And then he'd show that he will use decisive military force when that happens.\n",
            "[16:41.880 --> 16:43.520]  But then here's what's crazy.\n",
            "[16:43.520 --> 16:46.160]  And this is where I think you become a real superpower.\n",
            "[16:46.160 --> 16:48.680]  This is what happens after.\n",
            "[16:48.680 --> 16:54.200]  Once you cross the line, you notice that he doesn't try to humiliate or dominate Iran.\n",
            "[16:54.200 --> 16:57.640]  He tells Iran that he wants them to stabilize themselves.\n",
            "[16:57.640 --> 17:01.360]  He told them that he wants to see them trading oil with China.\n",
            "[17:01.360 --> 17:06.520]  He wants to see them improving the lives of their people because he realizes that a stable\n",
            "[17:06.520 --> 17:08.840]  Iran is a stable Middle East.\n",
            "[17:08.840 --> 17:10.960]  So I think it's really amazing.\n",
            "[17:10.960 --> 17:15.560]  And then the fact that he was able to bring Israel and Iran, who's been on the verge of\n",
            "[17:15.560 --> 17:21.560]  some kind of conflict for decades and broker a ceasefire, it's a really important moment\n",
            "[17:21.560 --> 17:22.680]  I think in American history.\n",
            "[17:22.680 --> 17:28.000]  I really do think that if you look at my little framework, it is the closest thing for\n",
            "[17:28.000 --> 17:34.840]  us to being able to say that we are truly a clear, singular, hegemon global superpower\n",
            "[17:34.840 --> 17:35.840]  again.\n",
            "[17:35.840 --> 17:36.840]  And that's really exciting.\n",
            "[17:36.840 --> 17:42.680]  Well, he definitely did provide that golden bridge for Iran to cross over to and maybe\n",
            "[17:42.680 --> 17:43.840]  move into another phase.\n",
            "[17:43.840 --> 17:47.280]  But freeberg, maybe you could still man the other side of this just for the discussion\n",
            "[17:47.280 --> 17:48.280]  here.\n",
            "[17:48.280 --> 17:50.360]  This could have gone another direction.\n",
            "[17:50.360 --> 17:53.600]  We could be sitting here and there could be terrorist attacks or sleeper cells.\n",
            "[17:53.600 --> 17:57.600]  You know, in the United States, it could turn out when we do the post-mortem here that\n",
            "[17:57.600 --> 18:02.440]  they weren't close to having a nuclear bomb and we did this and we got goaded into it.\n",
            "[18:02.440 --> 18:06.320]  So maybe obviously things have gone well to date, but things might not have.\n",
            "[18:06.320 --> 18:08.760]  So maybe you could still man the other side of this.\n",
            "[18:08.760 --> 18:11.240]  What's the argument for not having done this?\n",
            "[18:11.240 --> 18:17.160]  And what if things had gone another way, how bad could this be?\n",
            "[18:17.160 --> 18:18.960]  I don't know if this is over.\n",
            "[18:18.960 --> 18:20.840]  So, well, that's my point.\n",
            "[18:20.840 --> 18:21.840]  Yeah.\n",
            "[18:21.840 --> 18:26.520]  I mean, we're kind of in the middle of a two-year-old adventure book here.\n",
            "[18:26.520 --> 18:36.000]  And I've got to imagine that the Israelis and Netanyahu who's been pretty vocal about this\n",
            "[18:36.000 --> 18:43.000]  regime that's been shouting for decades now, death to Israel, death to the USA needs\n",
            "[18:43.000 --> 18:48.520]  to change is going to suddenly say, hey, let's take a beat and walk away from this and\n",
            "[18:48.520 --> 18:51.080]  we'll all kind of have peace in the Middle East.\n",
            "[18:51.080 --> 18:55.000]  I think we've got to expect that there's another page that's coming.\n",
            "[18:55.000 --> 18:58.360]  And I don't know if you guys heard, I don't know if it's genuine or if it's authentic\n",
            "[18:58.360 --> 18:59.360]  or not.\n",
            "[18:59.360 --> 19:05.680]  Did you hear that audio of one of the kind of Mossad or IDF people calling an IRGC commander\n",
            "[19:05.680 --> 19:09.760]  and telling him that he has 24 hours to leave Iran with his wife and child?\n",
            "[19:09.760 --> 19:10.760]  Did you guys hear that?\n",
            "[19:10.760 --> 19:11.760]  Yeah.\n",
            "[19:11.760 --> 19:12.760]  I'm not.\n",
            "[19:12.760 --> 19:13.760]  I saw it.\n",
            "[19:13.760 --> 19:14.760]  I mean, I heard it.\n",
            "[19:14.760 --> 19:16.480]  It's pretty incredible.\n",
            "[19:16.480 --> 19:22.520]  And I've got to imagine that there's going to continue to be effort to destabilize whatever\n",
            "[19:22.520 --> 19:27.200]  regime remains in Iran by Israel, Mossad.\n",
            "[19:27.200 --> 19:31.680]  And this isn't going to be kind of a quiet, peaceful transition.\n",
            "[19:31.680 --> 19:33.200]  There's going to continue to be more conflict.\n",
            "[19:33.200 --> 19:37.360]  Like whether these guys are going to be trading missiles back and forth tomorrow, I think,\n",
            "[19:37.360 --> 19:39.200]  we don't really know.\n",
            "[19:39.200 --> 19:40.960]  But this isn't over.\n",
            "[19:40.960 --> 19:44.440]  And I do think that the next set of actions is going to be critical.\n",
            "[19:44.440 --> 19:48.320]  But what I was pretty surprised by, I did not, like everyone was saying, hey, we're\n",
            "[19:48.320 --> 19:49.800]  on the brink of World War III.\n",
            "[19:49.800 --> 19:55.680]  I mean, there was some serious statesmanship that must have gone on to keep China.\n",
            "[19:55.680 --> 20:01.040]  And I have no IDF had no insight or conversations with anyone to give me any sort of proprietary\n",
            "[20:01.040 --> 20:03.040]  access to knowledge about what's gone on here.\n",
            "[20:03.040 --> 20:07.520]  And I've got to imagine there were calls to China and Russia that kept them in the loop\n",
            "[20:07.520 --> 20:11.080]  and kept them in play on how this all played out.\n",
            "[20:11.080 --> 20:14.200]  Because China and Russia, the whole fear was this was going to create this magnet in\n",
            "[20:14.200 --> 20:15.760]  the Middle East that everything was going to rush in.\n",
            "[20:15.760 --> 20:19.280]  And we're going to catalyze World War III and it didn't happen.\n",
            "[20:19.280 --> 20:25.520]  So I do think that, you know, first of all, nothing that folks predicted actually happened\n",
            "[20:25.520 --> 20:27.680]  and no one predicted what did happen.\n",
            "[20:27.680 --> 20:30.280]  So I'm not going to sit here and try and talk about it.\n",
            "[20:30.280 --> 20:32.760]  I'm not going to sit here and try and predict what happened.\n",
            "[20:32.800 --> 20:37.400]  And I will say if I'm thinking about like, you know, game theory optimal poker play,\n",
            "[20:37.400 --> 20:42.120]  I got to give credit to this president because it was completely unpredictable what was\n",
            "[20:42.120 --> 20:43.120]  coming next.\n",
            "[20:43.120 --> 20:47.120]  And I don't think that there was a really clear path in what he was going to do.\n",
            "[20:47.120 --> 20:51.080]  Just like what has happened repeatedly, everyone always slams a table and says he's\n",
            "[20:51.080 --> 20:52.080]  starting World War III.\n",
            "[20:52.080 --> 20:54.160]  He's driving economic collapse.\n",
            "[20:54.160 --> 20:55.400]  Everything's about to end.\n",
            "[20:55.400 --> 21:00.120]  And then it turns out he kind of ducks and weaves and finds his way through.\n",
            "[21:00.120 --> 21:02.400]  And everyone's like, holy shit, I didn't expect that to happen.\n",
            "[21:02.400 --> 21:04.040]  It was, it's very unpredictable.\n",
            "[21:04.040 --> 21:04.960]  It's going to happen next.\n",
            "[21:04.960 --> 21:07.360]  So I am not going to sit here and try and estimate what's going to happen next.\n",
            "[21:07.360 --> 21:11.200]  I can tell you, I don't think these railings are going to sit by quietly and allow this\n",
            "[21:11.200 --> 21:16.120]  Iranian regime to continue to go out and build up a military that's constantly shouting\n",
            "[21:16.120 --> 21:18.560]  death to Israel, death to the USA.\n",
            "[21:18.560 --> 21:21.280]  And I think that they've taken their first shot and I don't think it's their last.\n",
            "[21:21.280 --> 21:22.760]  So we'll see how this all plays out.\n",
            "[21:22.760 --> 21:23.760]  I really don't know.\n",
            "[21:23.760 --> 21:25.080]  Well, I'm sure that's right.\n",
            "[21:25.080 --> 21:27.000]  Let me just tee up one person who did get it right.\n",
            "[21:27.000 --> 21:30.960]  Here's John Mishima at the All in Summit just nine months ago.\n",
            "[21:31.680 --> 21:34.560]  Let me play this clip here and get your reaction, Saks.\n",
            "[21:34.560 --> 21:41.760]  To counter the Iranian escalation scenario, the fact is Iran does not want to war with the\n",
            "[21:41.760 --> 21:42.760]  United States.\n",
            "[21:42.760 --> 21:46.200]  And the United States does not want to war with Iran.\n",
            "[21:46.200 --> 21:51.760]  And it's the Israelis, especially Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been trying to sort of suck\n",
            "[21:51.760 --> 21:58.880]  us into a war because he wants us, the United States, to really whack Iran, weaken it\n",
            "[21:58.880 --> 22:02.960]  militarily and especially to go after its nuclear capabilities.\n",
            "[22:02.960 --> 22:07.120]  Because as you well know, they are close to the point where they can develop nuclear\n",
            "[22:07.120 --> 22:08.120]  weapons.\n",
            "[22:08.120 --> 22:14.200]  So the Israelis are the ones who want us to get involved in a big war with Iran.\n",
            "[22:14.200 --> 22:16.200]  That's the escalation flashpoint.\n",
            "[22:16.200 --> 22:22.520]  And the $64,000 question is whether you think the United States and Iran kind of colluding\n",
            "[22:22.520 --> 22:26.680]  can work together to prevent the Israelis from getting a set.\n",
            "[22:26.840 --> 22:33.560]  That question will be answered based on the next who leads the next administration.\n",
            "[22:33.560 --> 22:38.760]  Well, if you believe that it matters who leads the next, the next.\n",
            "[22:38.760 --> 22:39.760]  And there are Saks.\n",
            "[22:39.760 --> 22:44.260]  There's you laughing for this incredible insight, which is, as you were saying last year,\n",
            "[22:44.260 --> 22:47.000]  and Mishima has been saying, this was manifest.\n",
            "[22:47.000 --> 22:48.000]  That's it.\n",
            "[22:48.000 --> 22:49.760]  This was going to happen no matter who was president.\n",
            "[22:49.760 --> 22:50.760]  And here we are.\n",
            "[22:50.760 --> 22:55.000]  So your thoughts on Mishima sort of, I mean, wow, he just nailed it there.\n",
            "[22:55.000 --> 22:58.120]  And that was to your question, Friedberg, by the way, so well done to Friedberg.\n",
            "[22:58.120 --> 23:01.840]  We didn't put your question at the beginning because he went on for five or ten minutes\n",
            "[23:01.840 --> 23:02.840]  there.\n",
            "[23:02.840 --> 23:06.320]  But go ahead, it's actually a reaction to Mishima's incredible prediction.\n",
            "[23:06.320 --> 23:09.440]  That's Professor Mishima being prophetic as usual.\n",
            "[23:09.440 --> 23:11.600]  But let me go back to a point that Friedberg was making.\n",
            "[23:11.600 --> 23:14.240]  To Friedberg's point here, this is not over.\n",
            "[23:14.240 --> 23:16.400]  Iran and Israel are mortal enemies.\n",
            "[23:16.400 --> 23:17.400]  And we have a ceasefire here.\n",
            "[23:17.400 --> 23:21.520]  We have a pause in the action, but it's going to flare up again at some point.\n",
            "[23:21.520 --> 23:24.640]  The question is what US policy is going to be.\n",
            "[23:24.720 --> 23:29.040]  I think that what President Trump did over the past two weeks is make it clear that number\n",
            "[23:29.040 --> 23:34.600]  one, the United States does not want to see Iran get a nuclear bomb and that we are willing\n",
            "[23:34.600 --> 23:37.480]  to take military action to prevent that.\n",
            "[23:37.480 --> 23:42.720]  But that that action will be narrowly targeted as narrowly targeted as possible to achieve\n",
            "[23:42.720 --> 23:43.720]  that objective.\n",
            "[23:43.720 --> 23:48.320]  Number two, that the United States does not have an interest in going to war to basically\n",
            "[23:48.320 --> 23:50.760]  achieve a regime change.\n",
            "[23:50.760 --> 23:55.360]  If the people of Iran want to make Iran great again by rising up and toppling the government\n",
            "[23:55.360 --> 23:56.840]  then that's up to them.\n",
            "[23:56.840 --> 23:59.520]  Certainly I think we would welcome that.\n",
            "[23:59.520 --> 24:04.760]  But the Trump administration rejected all of the calls over the past week or so for the\n",
            "[24:04.760 --> 24:09.120]  United States to plunge into a regime change war in Iran.\n",
            "[24:09.120 --> 24:12.480]  And that's why the Neocons right now are not happy at all.\n",
            "[24:12.480 --> 24:14.320]  So that's point number two.\n",
            "[24:14.320 --> 24:18.120]  Look, I think Trump found the right balance here, which is we are going to be narrowly\n",
            "[24:18.120 --> 24:24.480]  focused on preventing a threat to the United States, which is Iran having a nuclear bomb.\n",
            "[24:24.480 --> 24:28.640]  But we're not going to go plunging into another forever war, another regime change operation.\n",
            "[24:28.640 --> 24:31.080]  We've had plenty of experience with that in the Middle East.\n",
            "[24:31.080 --> 24:32.160]  None of it worked.\n",
            "[24:32.160 --> 24:38.660]  Every time we went for a regime change it backfired, backfired in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and\n",
            "[24:38.660 --> 24:39.660]  on and on.\n",
            "[24:39.660 --> 24:41.640]  So there's no reason to believe regime change would work.\n",
            "[24:41.640 --> 24:46.080]  And by the way, there's no way to get regime change in a country unless you send an American\n",
            "[24:46.080 --> 24:50.580]  GIs to basically keep that government propped up in power because it's almost certainly\n",
            "[24:50.580 --> 24:53.920]  going to be perceived as a puppet of the United States.\n",
            "[24:53.920 --> 24:59.100]  I mean, if you put, you know, raise a plovie or something, the Shah's son in power in Iran,\n",
            "[24:59.100 --> 25:02.000]  he's going to face an insurgency right away.\n",
            "[25:02.000 --> 25:05.280]  And there's no way that his government is going to stay in power without the American military\n",
            "[25:05.280 --> 25:08.720]  protecting him and keeping him in power at the end of a rifle barrel.\n",
            "[25:08.720 --> 25:13.560]  So this whole idea that you can achieve regime change without its evil twin, which is nation\n",
            "[25:13.560 --> 25:15.360]  building, is a total fantasy.\n",
            "[25:15.360 --> 25:16.920]  You can't do it.\n",
            "[25:16.920 --> 25:20.120]  You would need an American occupation going on for decades.\n",
            "[25:20.120 --> 25:24.680]  And I think that the Trump administration wisely rejected all of this giddy talk.\n",
            "[25:24.680 --> 25:31.080]  Remember in the first couple of days of that Israeli surprise attack where it was Israel\n",
            "[25:31.080 --> 25:36.120]  who hit Iran and there was all this talk about decapitation that the Iranian regime was\n",
            "[25:36.120 --> 25:37.120]  about to collapse.\n",
            "[25:37.120 --> 25:39.080]  It just needed a little bit of a push.\n",
            "[25:39.080 --> 25:40.080]  Lindsey Graham.\n",
            "[25:40.080 --> 25:41.080]  Lindsey Graham.\n",
            "[25:41.080 --> 25:45.680]  He said that was all heady talk that turned out not to be true.\n",
            "[25:45.680 --> 25:49.640]  There's no question that the Iranian regime took some damage, but they did not collapse.\n",
            "[25:49.640 --> 25:54.920]  And in fact, if you look at history, one of the things Mirasharmers pointed out is that\n",
            "[25:54.920 --> 25:57.400]  you don't get regime change just through air power alone.\n",
            "[25:57.400 --> 25:59.440]  It takes boots on the ground.\n",
            "[25:59.440 --> 26:04.280]  And most Americans are not willing to put boots on the ground in Iran to change the\n",
            "[26:04.280 --> 26:05.360]  regime there.\n",
            "[26:05.360 --> 26:09.040]  We believe that it's sufficient just to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.\n",
            "[26:09.040 --> 26:11.440]  That's what American policy should focus on.\n",
            "[26:11.440 --> 26:12.440]  I really felt for this.\n",
            "[26:12.440 --> 26:13.440]  What do you think?\n",
            "[26:13.440 --> 26:19.040]  Well, I really felt for this check raise from Trump who was like, yeah, no, we're not doing\n",
            "[26:19.040 --> 26:20.040]  this.\n",
            "[26:20.040 --> 26:21.040]  We're not doing this.\n",
            "[26:21.040 --> 26:22.240]  And all of a sudden he does it, right?\n",
            "[26:22.240 --> 26:23.400]  Nobody expected him to do it.\n",
            "[26:23.400 --> 26:26.720]  Everybody thought he was going to not intervene.\n",
            "[26:26.720 --> 26:33.160]  And I as a Gen X or like you, Saxon, and I guess Freeberg and Shemalt as well.\n",
            "[26:33.160 --> 26:37.920]  When I saw them building the case here in the Lindsey Graham's, you know, the hawks,\n",
            "[26:37.920 --> 26:41.280]  or reports of WMDs that were imminent.\n",
            "[26:41.280 --> 26:42.880]  Who knows if that's true?\n",
            "[26:42.880 --> 26:44.880]  These people support terrorists.\n",
            "[26:44.880 --> 26:48.040]  They're trying to assassinate the president became part of this.\n",
            "[26:48.040 --> 26:52.320]  Remember that for last time with Bush senior spreading democracy in the Middle East, the\n",
            "[26:52.320 --> 26:53.320]  regime changed stuff.\n",
            "[26:53.320 --> 26:54.720]  That may be all very nervous.\n",
            "[26:54.720 --> 26:59.120]  And I think the most important next step here is that this administration explained in\n",
            "[26:59.120 --> 27:01.640]  detail to the American people.\n",
            "[27:01.640 --> 27:04.160]  So we don't have another WMD situation.\n",
            "[27:04.160 --> 27:05.600]  Just honestly the truth.\n",
            "[27:05.600 --> 27:06.600]  Like did we hit them?\n",
            "[27:06.600 --> 27:08.320]  Did we hit some of them?\n",
            "[27:08.320 --> 27:09.320]  Was there imminent?\n",
            "[27:09.320 --> 27:10.440]  Was it sort of imminent?\n",
            "[27:10.440 --> 27:11.920]  We just need to have full disclosure here.\n",
            "[27:11.920 --> 27:16.120]  I don't like the attacking the press for a leak inside of the administration.\n",
            "[27:16.120 --> 27:19.520]  It's the administration's, you know, responsibility to not have leaks.\n",
            "[27:19.520 --> 27:25.560]  And it's the press and the opposing party whoever opposes this action to really vet this.\n",
            "[27:25.560 --> 27:27.520]  And we need that part of the democratic process.\n",
            "[27:27.520 --> 27:33.000]  I hope we don't shut that down and we just blindly follow, you know, the leader because\n",
            "[27:33.000 --> 27:35.040]  it went well because this isn't over.\n",
            "[27:35.040 --> 27:36.040]  Number one.\n",
            "[27:36.040 --> 27:37.640]  So it did go well.\n",
            "[27:37.640 --> 27:39.080]  Huge credit to Trump for that.\n",
            "[27:39.080 --> 27:44.320]  If it does go well in the ends, the war in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, like give them\n",
            "[27:44.320 --> 27:45.320]  the peace prize.\n",
            "[27:45.320 --> 27:46.840]  I'm all for it.\n",
            "[27:46.840 --> 27:47.840]  Fantastic.\n",
            "[27:47.840 --> 27:51.720]  But let's get the disclosures here and let's not blame the press for getting a leak.\n",
            "[27:51.720 --> 27:55.600]  Let's actually look at this and explain to the American people what we accomplished, what\n",
            "[27:55.600 --> 27:58.440]  didn't get accomplished and what the realistic next step is.\n",
            "[27:58.440 --> 28:03.240]  And I give them a lot of credit for telling Israel where the line is and given the golden\n",
            "[28:03.240 --> 28:06.000]  bridge to Iran.\n",
            "[28:06.000 --> 28:10.040]  They will have a revolution on their own timeline, but we should not be part of that.\n",
            "[28:10.040 --> 28:11.040]  Right.\n",
            "[28:11.040 --> 28:12.640]  That's the lesson we learned to your point, Saks.\n",
            "[28:12.640 --> 28:15.520]  We can't be the revolution in Iran.\n",
            "[28:15.520 --> 28:16.520]  They have to be revolution.\n",
            "[28:16.520 --> 28:17.520]  It's got to come from the bottom up.\n",
            "[28:17.520 --> 28:20.720]  I mean, it may also disagree with one of the things you said, which is you said you\n",
            "[28:20.720 --> 28:25.920]  were starting to get nervous about the the the stampede towards war.\n",
            "[28:25.920 --> 28:28.880]  I think you were correctly perceiving what was happening in the media.\n",
            "[28:28.880 --> 28:32.080]  I mean, and this includes Fox News, especially Fox News.\n",
            "[28:32.080 --> 28:34.120]  There was all this talk about how easy it would be.\n",
            "[28:34.120 --> 28:37.800]  There'd be a cakewalk that the government was on its last legs and it was weak that\n",
            "[28:37.800 --> 28:39.120]  it was basically almost topple.\n",
            "[28:39.120 --> 28:40.640]  We just need to push it over.\n",
            "[28:40.640 --> 28:44.560]  You're right about the WMD talk that talk about the assassination.\n",
            "[28:44.560 --> 28:50.040]  This is all like a literally like a carbon copy of the arguments that were made back in\n",
            "[28:50.040 --> 28:51.040]  2003.\n",
            "[28:51.040 --> 28:53.880]  It's the playbook to get us into the Iraq war.\n",
            "[28:53.880 --> 28:55.920]  But look, I think two things are different now.\n",
            "[28:55.920 --> 28:58.720]  Number one is President Trump is not George W. Bush.\n",
            "[28:58.720 --> 29:00.800]  I mean, that was made abundantly clear.\n",
            "[29:00.800 --> 29:05.960]  Number two is we now have alternative media that even though the mainstream media and Fox\n",
            "[29:05.960 --> 29:10.600]  News was basically acting like this was 2003, you had alternative media and you had people\n",
            "[29:10.600 --> 29:12.840]  like Tucker Carlson speaking out and Steve Bannon.\n",
            "[29:12.840 --> 29:18.520]  I have to give him credit on this and others who were pointing this out and making the case\n",
            "[29:18.520 --> 29:20.160]  that this would not go well.\n",
            "[29:20.160 --> 29:26.360]  And I do think that it's been very helpful to have those course of voices as a rebuttal.\n",
            "[29:26.360 --> 29:30.480]  You know, you correctly felt that we were being pushed into war.\n",
            "[29:30.480 --> 29:35.600]  But I think this was different now because 20 years later, people remember what happened,\n",
            "[29:35.600 --> 29:39.200]  at least enough do that they're able to make the countercase.\n",
            "[29:39.200 --> 29:44.000]  And I think that fortunately we have a decision maker in chief who also remembers and\n",
            "[29:44.000 --> 29:45.320]  listens to those arguments.\n",
            "[29:45.320 --> 29:46.320]  All right.\n",
            "[29:46.320 --> 29:48.280]  I think we've made some good progress here.\n",
            "[29:48.280 --> 29:49.280]  Let's move on in the docket.\n",
            "[29:49.280 --> 29:53.080]  We've got a lot of other topics to talk about.\n",
            "[29:53.080 --> 29:54.720]  Obviously, oil prices to mop.\n",
            "[29:54.720 --> 29:57.960]  You had talked about those in relation to this action.\n",
            "[29:57.960 --> 30:00.440]  You said, Hey, if this goes poorly, we could be looking at a hundred.\n",
            "[30:00.440 --> 30:08.040]  A barrel of oil quite interestingly while it did spike a little bit up to $74, almost\n",
            "[30:08.040 --> 30:09.640]  hit your $100.\n",
            "[30:09.640 --> 30:13.000]  Chimoff racing up from the $60 mark.\n",
            "[30:13.000 --> 30:14.200]  You know, we come back down now.\n",
            "[30:14.200 --> 30:17.280]  And I think people are energy independence here in the United States.\n",
            "[30:17.280 --> 30:20.920]  Makes us not immune to this, but we're somewhat protected.\n",
            "[30:20.920 --> 30:24.200]  And I think that's the great thing about energy independence.\n",
            "[30:24.200 --> 30:26.200]  But here we are.\n",
            "[30:26.200 --> 30:28.160]  The markets have digested this.\n",
            "[30:28.160 --> 30:33.720]  Priced it in process that in a way that I think maybe none of us thought it would.\n",
            "[30:33.720 --> 30:39.160]  So maybe you could unpack your thinking now on the market's reaction to the war.\n",
            "[30:39.160 --> 30:44.920]  The fear that I had was that if there was a protracted conflict, what you effectively\n",
            "[30:44.920 --> 30:51.640]  would see is a bunch of supply go offline.\n",
            "[30:51.640 --> 30:56.920]  And if that supply went offline, and as long as the demand state even roughly the same,\n",
            "[30:56.920 --> 30:58.120]  you would see prices go up.\n",
            "[30:58.120 --> 31:01.480]  My thought was that the price of oil could double.\n",
            "[31:01.480 --> 31:05.160]  I think Goldman had it slightly under a doubling.\n",
            "[31:05.160 --> 31:12.000]  So that was definitely the fear what folks had going into that weekend.\n",
            "[31:12.000 --> 31:16.040]  But coming out of it, this is where I think you have to be very respectful of the fact\n",
            "[31:16.040 --> 31:22.520]  that the market is really the sum of many, many, many millions of informed opinions.\n",
            "[31:22.520 --> 31:29.640]  And I think what they saw was that Iran was not really in a position to do anything but\n",
            "[31:29.640 --> 31:32.760]  capitulate and give up.\n",
            "[31:32.760 --> 31:39.240]  And I think that what they also saw, whether you agree with the Israeli policy or not,\n",

            "[31:55.920 --> 32:02.000]  I think finally putting a nail in the coffin of this Iran nuclear ambition program was not\n",
            "[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  just important for them, but it's critical for Saudi and the UAE.\n",
            "[32:06.000 --> 32:12.200]  Now, MBS had an incredibly powerful quote, which was if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, we\n",

            "[32:15.520 --> 32:22.600]  So by taking all of that risk off the table, what you're now talking about is an enormous\n",

            "[32:36.160 --> 32:41.880]  So I think what the market realized was, okay, now the Middle East is the closest it's\n",
            "[32:41.880 --> 32:50.600]  ever been to fully monetizing the oil that they have and to invest aggressively into their\n",

            "[33:14.080 --> 33:19.520]  But the second punch is the one that then now creates normalization across the region\n",

            "[33:21.440 --> 33:26.760]  It doubles and triples down the ability to monetize oil and start to invest those returns\n",

            "[34:42.920 --> 34:49.320]  So the relationship between Iran and China and the importance of that relationship to\n",

            "[35:52.520 --> 35:58.480]  they all seem to have a very strong imperative and incentive to modernize the Middle East,\n",
            "[35:58.480 --> 36:03.840]  to bring those economies into the global stage, to bring them into kind of a modern economy.\n",

            "[36:17.480 --> 36:21.640]  They will ultimately net producers of things that everyone else will buy and participate\n",
            "[36:21.640 --> 36:23.840]  and they will also be very big consumers.\n",
            "[36:23.840 --> 36:29.400]  They are already very big buyers of American technology and American businesses and also\n",
            "[36:29.400 --> 36:32.560]  big financiers of global capitalism.\n",
            "[36:32.560 --> 36:38.440]  So in that context, I don't think it's just about, hey, we got to go get the oil or hey,\n",

            "[36:39.960 --> 36:43.560]  It's about how do you balance China's need for energy?\n",

            "[36:48.240 --> 36:52.600]  And I think that's where there's a very complex dance underway that we have very little\n",

            "[36:54.760 --> 36:57.880]  And I'm not going to just sit here and be like, very flippant about, oh, we should do this\n",
            "[36:57.880 --> 37:00.800]  or we should do that because there's a lot at play.\n",
            "[37:00.800 --> 37:05.800]  And I think that that is, in my opinion, the net calculus, the bigger picture calculus\n",
            "[37:05.800 --> 37:09.160]  that's underway in trying to transition the region.\n",
            "[37:09.160 --> 37:13.200]  Zach, let me ask you a question here, leveling it up pretty well known.\n",
            "[37:13.200 --> 37:16.720]  The Israelis have nuclear weapons and many of them.\n",
            "[37:16.720 --> 37:20.720]  And they have for some time, even though they're not part of any of the treaties and they\n",
            "[37:20.720 --> 37:24.640]  will claim they don't or be a little coy about it.\n",
            "[37:24.640 --> 37:28.920]  What is the argument for nobody else in the region being allowed to have one if the Israelis\n",
            "[37:28.920 --> 37:30.400]  have many?\n",
            "[37:30.400 --> 37:35.680]  And would you be okay with Saudi having nuclear bombs?\n",
            "[37:35.680 --> 37:41.520]  And what is the argument we would make to them as the West Americans people who have nuclear\n",
            "[37:41.520 --> 37:44.360]  weapons, Russia, China have them.\n",
            "[37:44.360 --> 37:45.640]  Why can't Saudi have them?\n",
            "[37:45.640 --> 37:50.720]  Make sure best argument to them of not acquiring them if the Israelis have dozens to hundreds.\n",
            "[37:50.720 --> 37:53.600]  Well, nuclear proliferation is just not in our interest.\n",
            "[37:53.600 --> 37:55.960]  We don't want more countries getting nuclear weapons.\n",
            "[37:55.960 --> 37:58.400]  Obviously, some countries have them.\n",
            "[37:58.400 --> 38:01.640]  But if you use that as the rationalization for everyone being able to have them, then\n",
            "[38:01.640 --> 38:03.840]  you're going to end up with 200 countries have nuclear weapons.\n",
            "[38:03.840 --> 38:08.640]  So I think the nuclear non-proliferation regime is in the interest of the United States.\n",
            "[38:08.640 --> 38:10.520]  We all understand the danger of these weapons.\n",
            "[38:10.520 --> 38:14.200]  The more countries that have them, the more dangerous the world becomes.\n",
            "[38:14.200 --> 38:19.120]  Now it is true that unofficially the Israelis have nuclear weapons.\n",
            "[38:19.120 --> 38:23.860]  But like you were saying before, if Iran gets nukes, then Saudi Arabia will be forced to\n",
            "[38:23.860 --> 38:25.640]  get nukes and so on down the line.\n",
            "[38:25.640 --> 38:30.360]  And so there will be a domino effect with each country that gets nuclear weapons more\n",
            "[38:30.360 --> 38:36.320]  countries around them will feel the need that are threatened to have their own deterrent.\n",
            "[38:36.320 --> 38:38.440]  And the question is just where you stop this.\n",
            "[38:38.440 --> 38:40.640]  And I think we just want to stop it here.\n",
            "[38:40.640 --> 38:44.800]  We don't want more countries getting nuclear weapons, particularly ones that we have hostile\n",
            "[38:44.800 --> 38:45.880]  relations with.\n",
            "[38:45.880 --> 38:46.880]  Yeah.\n",
            "[38:46.880 --> 38:51.560]  And the last country to give up their nuclear weapons, Ukraine.\n",
            "[38:51.560 --> 38:52.560]  Really bad decision, perhaps.\n",
            "[38:52.560 --> 38:53.560]  I think in the last example.\n",
            "[38:53.560 --> 38:55.560]  Well, that was in the 90s.\n",
            "[38:55.560 --> 39:01.240]  Actually, another country gave up their nuclear weapons program, which was Libya.\n",
            "[39:01.240 --> 39:06.720]  And what happened to get offy, he got killed by rebels who were being backed by the United\n",
            "[39:06.720 --> 39:09.560]  States after he gave up his nuclear weapons program.\n",
            "[39:09.560 --> 39:11.560]  Yeah, I think that was a really bad.\n",
            "[39:11.560 --> 39:12.560]  Well, you great.\n",
            "[39:12.560 --> 39:14.680]  Actually had the weapons, not just a program, right?\n",
            "[39:14.680 --> 39:17.400]  But there's some truth to that.\n",
            "[39:17.400 --> 39:21.320]  But that's a little bit simplified situation because what happened is at the end of the\n",
            "[39:21.320 --> 39:25.280]  Soviet Union, there were a bunch of Soviet nukes that were in Ukraine.\n",
            "[39:25.280 --> 39:29.200]  But as I understand it, the launch codes were in Moscow.\n",
            "[39:29.200 --> 39:34.120]  So these were Soviet nuclear weapons that happened to be on Ukrainian soil.\n",
            "[39:34.120 --> 39:36.880]  And then when the Soviet Union came apart, they were there.\n",
            "[39:36.880 --> 39:39.680]  But they were always under the control of Moscow.\n",
            "[39:39.680 --> 39:46.600]  And so I don't think that the Ukrainians gave up much because they were never there nukes.\n",
            "[39:46.600 --> 39:48.800]  It's not clear they could have used them.\n",
            "[39:48.800 --> 39:53.440]  And one final point on this is that it was the Russian government and the American government\n",
            "[39:53.440 --> 39:58.320]  that pressured Ukraine to comply because we don't want more countries having nuclear weapons.\n",
            "[39:58.320 --> 39:59.320]  Okay.\n",
            "[39:59.320 --> 40:03.280]  Let's get on to this democratic social list who is on the verge of becoming New York\n",

            "[40:21.000 --> 40:24.160]  Zoran had a 6 percent chance.\n",
            "[40:24.160 --> 40:27.080]  My lord, what a flip.\n",
            "[40:27.080 --> 40:29.000]  A couple of things happened that led to this.\n",
            "[40:29.000 --> 40:30.760]  Obviously, a bunch of viral moments.\n",
            "[40:30.760 --> 40:31.760]  He's a great speaker.\n",
            "[40:31.760 --> 40:38.480]  Reminds me of Vic in that regard, really good, you know, in debates and speaking publicly.\n",
            "[40:38.480 --> 40:39.720]  Started rising in the polls.\n",
            "[40:39.720 --> 40:46.400]  Got a ton of endorsements from millennials, Gen Z, AOC endorsed him as well.\n",
            "[40:46.400 --> 40:52.480]  And now he is Mamdani is the 75 percent favorite to beat Eric Adams.\n",
            "[40:52.480 --> 40:56.720]  But looks like Eric Adams is going to get a shocking amount of support because people\n",

            "[44:03.120 --> 44:08.120]  And what we did is we increased the government's role in making that dream possible.\n",
            "[44:08.120 --> 44:13.280]  And in doing so, we created effectively a system where we gave unrestricted access to\n",

            "[44:17.080 --> 44:22.080]  People could go to school like Zoran and major in African studies at Bowdoin College.\n",

            "[44:37.600 --> 44:41.440]  And they will never get out of the debt cycle that they were thrust into and believe\n",

            "[44:46.520 --> 44:49.520]  They all have what is called negative capital.\n",
            "[44:49.520 --> 44:51.960]  They have debt and they will never be able to get out of that cycle.\n",
            "[44:51.960 --> 44:53.960]  So where do you turn in that moment?\n",
            "[44:53.960 --> 44:56.360]  You don't go turn to corporations to solve your problems.\n",
            "[44:56.360 --> 44:59.480]  You don't go turn to your friends and your siblings and your family.\n",

            "[45:01.640 --> 45:06.800]  You turn to the voting booth and you hear a guy like Zoran show up and say there can\n",
            "[45:06.800 --> 45:08.760]  be a better path forward.\n",
            "[45:08.760 --> 45:13.480]  The better path forward is the government can and should do more to help.\n",
            "[45:13.480 --> 45:15.800]  And then doing more to help we will increase government.\n",
            "[45:15.800 --> 45:16.800]  We will tax the rich.\n",
            "[45:16.800 --> 45:18.440]  We will tax the corporations.\n",
            "[45:18.440 --> 45:23.760]  We will take all of that capital and we will redistribute it in the form of services and\n",

            "[45:29.640 --> 45:34.720]  And this becomes a tipping point when the majority of the voter base ends up in that situation\n",
            "[45:34.720 --> 45:37.600]  where they're that deeply in need where they have negative capital.\n",
            "[45:37.600 --> 45:40.400]  And that is the situation America finds itself in today.\n",
            "[45:40.400 --> 45:43.240]  There is no easy answer and there is no easy solution out of this.\n",
            "[45:43.240 --> 45:47.520]  But I can tell you one thing for sure that in historical perspective, we have seen a\n",
            "[45:47.520 --> 45:52.880]  time and time again across dozens of countries that have embraced socialism to get out of\n",
            "[45:52.880 --> 45:57.080]  the debt cycle that ultimately absorbs and and swallows up.\n",
            "[45:57.080 --> 45:59.120]  Beyond it swallows up every family.\n",
            "[45:59.120 --> 46:02.120]  It swallows up every person in the working class with debt.\n",
            "[46:02.120 --> 46:06.000]  They're swaddled with it and they all try and get out of it by increasing government\n",
            "[46:06.000 --> 46:08.040]  and embracing these socialist concepts.\n",
            "[46:08.040 --> 46:09.960]  And it has never, ever worked.\n",
            "[46:10.000 --> 46:11.720]  Our government is not the answer.\n",
            "[46:11.720 --> 46:13.560]  Less government is we can get into that.\n",
            "[46:13.560 --> 46:19.320]  But if you look at the results, Zoran won 61 to 39 with college educated.\n",
            "[46:19.320 --> 46:20.560]  Young people voted for him.\n",
            "[46:20.560 --> 46:22.440]  Old people did not as much.\n",
            "[46:22.440 --> 46:25.000]  White people voted for him because they went to college.\n",
            "[46:25.000 --> 46:27.320]  Non-white people did not as much.\n",
            "[46:27.320 --> 46:31.960]  At the end of the day, young college educated white people elected this guy.\n",
            "[46:31.960 --> 46:35.320]  And that is the beginning of a wave that will sweep over America.\n",
            "[46:35.320 --> 46:37.080]  And I really do worry about where this takes that.\n",
            "[46:37.080 --> 46:39.920]  So way to go for dummies.\n",
            "[46:40.400 --> 46:43.200]  Yeah, I mean, the you're correct.\n",

            "[46:48.840 --> 46:50.360]  It really isn't just college.\n",
            "[46:50.360 --> 46:54.800]  It's the cost of college increases in the cost of college degrees have outpaced\n",

            "[47:08.240 --> 47:10.720]  And you don't believe in capitalism anymore.\n",
            "[47:10.720 --> 47:13.440]  And you believe that you need to tax the rich.\n",
            "[47:13.440 --> 47:17.520]  Just one warning for people in these states and these cities.\n",
            "[47:17.520 --> 47:20.160]  We saw this in San Francisco.\n",

            "[47:30.160 --> 47:32.640]  In Los Angeles, we saw this with Karen Bass.\n",
            "[47:32.640 --> 47:33.760]  They didn't vote for Recruis.\n",
            "[47:33.760 --> 47:35.600]  So he would have been an amazing mayor.\n",
            "[47:35.680 --> 47:40.960]  They voted for incompetence and these people are voting for incompetence and a plan that\n",

            "[47:49.120 --> 47:54.560]  They will see that Austin and Miami are fantastic cities to live in at half the price,\n",
            "[47:54.560 --> 47:57.360]  a third of the price and you get a tax break.\n",
            "[47:57.360 --> 48:00.800]  And you can always go back to New York and California and hang out for a month and get\n",

            "[48:04.800 --> 48:08.480]  by the socialist and the incompetent people running them.\n",

            "[48:12.880 --> 48:17.920]  Well, you're right that every generation seems to need to learn this lesson for themselves\n",
            "[48:17.920 --> 48:22.560]  because they don't study history and they don't see that socialism always fails wherever it's\n",
            "[48:22.560 --> 48:24.880]  tried. San Francisco went through this.\n",
            "[48:24.880 --> 48:27.200]  I mean, it was a doom spiral.\n",
            "[48:27.200 --> 48:28.880]  Now I think we've turned the corner.\n",
            "[48:28.880 --> 48:33.280]  LA is in the midst of going through it and a large portion of LA just burned down because\n",

            "[48:35.360 --> 48:37.520]  Basically, all the public services have been looted.\n",
            "[48:38.320 --> 48:40.400]  And New York is about to learn this for themselves.\n",
            "[48:40.400 --> 48:42.960]  So it just seems like every generation just has to learn this.\n",
            "[48:42.960 --> 48:43.840]  There's no way to teach them.\n",
            "[48:44.560 --> 48:47.040]  So I do think that that is one thing that's going on.\n",
            "[48:47.040 --> 48:51.600]  I do agree with Freeberg that a big underlying root cause here is the student dead.\n",
            "[48:51.600 --> 48:54.480]  It's the fact that these kids have negative capital.\n",
            "[48:54.480 --> 48:55.920]  They've got no skin in the game.\n",
            "[48:55.920 --> 49:01.040]  They graduate from college with worthless degrees and massive amounts of debt that debt was not\n",

            "[49:19.680 --> 49:22.720]  And so this is part of why they're they're turning against capitalism.\n",
            "[49:22.720 --> 49:26.720]  One thing we need to do, by the way, is we need to make the student debt\n",
            "[49:27.360 --> 49:29.200]  dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n",
            "[49:29.200 --> 49:30.480]  It's one of your own.\n",
            "[49:30.480 --> 49:34.720]  It's the only kind of debt that you can't get out of through bankruptcy.\n",
            "[49:34.720 --> 49:37.520]  And if we were to make that change, at least these kids would have a way out.\n",

            "[54:33.440 --> 54:38.000]  And to all my friends on the tech right, your choices in the future and I can be neo-liberalism\n",
            "[54:38.000 --> 54:41.840]  and neo-conservatism it's going to be, do you want Republican nationalism or do you want\n",

            "[54:44.800 --> 54:50.480]  So I would get with the program here because your choices are mega or socialism, which one do you\n",

            "[56:09.360 --> 56:13.600]  to the next time. I think the three of you guys are a little exaggerated to be quite honest. I mean,\n",
            "[56:13.600 --> 56:18.000]  all the rhetoric sounds very clever, but I don't think it's accurate. I think the way that I see it\n",
            "[56:18.000 --> 56:28.560]  is more nuanced than this. I think what's happened is that Zoraan Mamdani is very smart and is running\n",

            "[56:43.680 --> 56:49.520]  worth noting that most of his platform is copied and pasted from London and Chicago.\n",
            "[56:50.640 --> 56:54.960]  So the things that he's talked about, universal basic free meals, affordable housing,\n",
            "[56:54.960 --> 57:00.240]  freezing the cost of transportation, public grocery stores, all three of you are reacting like\n",
            "[57:00.240 --> 57:05.440]  these things were pulled out of thin air, they're not. These were the public platforms of the mayors\n",
            "[57:05.520 --> 57:16.080]  who have won in London, in Vienna, in Havana, Cuba, and in Chicago. So I think the reason why this\n",
            "[57:16.080 --> 57:21.600]  works is that these are small pockets in the end of a large political spectrum. Even though New York\n",
            "[57:21.600 --> 57:28.000]  feels big, it isn't that big in the context of the United States. And what you see is that when you\n",
            "[57:28.080 --> 57:35.600]  try to take those policies in a city, take London, and then level it up at the national level,\n",
            "[57:36.560 --> 57:41.840]  there's a quick schism that happens. So if you look at labor and labor trying to scale up the\n",
            "[57:41.840 --> 57:49.600]  policies of a Cedric Khan in London throughout the country, labor is now at the absolute labor party,\n",
            "[57:49.600 --> 57:57.120]  the absolute lowest approval ratings in the UK of any party ever in this moment in time after an\n",
            "[57:57.120 --> 58:05.280]  election. So I think what you're probably seeing is quite a sophisticated AB test. And I think that\n",
            "[58:05.280 --> 58:12.640]  the political wing men and the money people that want to be in control know how to run candidates\n",
            "[58:12.640 --> 58:19.760]  on platforms that can win. And this is a clear winning strategy in left leaning major metropolitan\n",
            "[58:19.760 --> 58:26.480]  centers. So what I would say just as we're fine, what you guys are saying is that this platform is not\n",

            "[58:33.440 --> 58:40.000]  It doesn't work. And so you're going to see the same results in New York City that you've already\n",

            "[58:45.600 --> 58:52.960]  don't believe it, go visit there. Chicago, which I haven't been to in 15 years and I never go to,\n",
            "[58:52.960 --> 59:00.880]  it's a disaster. So my point is it just doesn't work. So you can win. It actually isn't very effective.\n",
            "[59:00.880 --> 59:05.200]  And it doesn't scale to the national level. When you think it returns to mock, like what's the\n",

            "[59:44.720 --> 59:50.320]  it's not the thing before. So I suspect what happens is that New York takes a 40 or 50-year\n",
            "[59:50.320 --> 59:57.440]  journey. And at some point, it will look like New York of the 80s. And at that point, you'll have\n",

            "[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.680]  a model. Interestingly, on top of that, I did a licensing deal. Harper's business did a deal\n",
            "[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:57.840]  with Harper's with Microsoft and I picked 2500 books to license angel for their model. There\n",
            "[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:06.480]  are also legal routes. No, literally for the whole book. I know it's crazy. No, everybody got\n",
            "[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:12.240]  the same deal. They licensed like, I don't know, 5,000 books or something. Per word? Per word.\n",
            "[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.320]  Wow. I used to get $3 a word back in the day. But actually, for that book, what did I get?\n",
            "[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:24.080]  I got $25 a word, I guess, with a million dollar deal. Metta also prevailed against a group of notable\n",
            "[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.880]  authors, including Sarah Silverman. Now we know why he's so long-winded. He gets paid by the word.\n",
            "[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.560]  Absolutely. That's actually my tip. Now we know why. There was a cut or anything. This goes on\n",
            "[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:40.480]  and on and on. Absolutely. That's why we're the number one podcast in the world. You guys\n",
            "[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.080]  sent me my flowers. You know the address of the ranch. Okay. So there was another one with Metta.\n",
            "[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.960]  The judge ultimately sided with Metta. He had a mixed ruling. Basically said that copyright\n",
            "[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.000]  protective works without permission is generally illegal. But the plaintiffs and plaintiffs in that\n",

            "[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.280]  one. You have to have some harm in these cases in order for it to play. A ton of other cases still\n",
            "[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:13.120]  in play. The big one is the New York Times versus open AI and getty images versus stable diffusion.\n",
            "[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:18.160]  We'll follow those as they make their way through the courts. But here you are. It's actually\n",
            "[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:24.800]  you are the czar of AI. So I don't know if we're getting an official position here or just your\n",
            "[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:31.280]  personal thoughts on this. But what's the interpretation of these two early cases by the czar?\n",
            "[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.160]  Do you think? Well, I'll tell you my point of view. I don't know that I can speak for everybody,\n",
            "[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.000]  but I'll give you my point of view, which actually is the same point of view I gave on this podcast\n",
            "[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.400]  a year or two ago because we had this debate over fair use. I mean, for Berg, we're on one side\n",
            "[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.160]  and you are on another side. This judge in the anthropic case, I mean, the the reasoning that he\n",
            "[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:57.040]  gave was almost identical to what Freeberg and I were arguing a year ago. And the distinction he made\n",
            "[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:05.760]  is between input and output. If an AI model outputs some text that is basically a ripoff of\n",
            "[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.760]  someone else's copyright, then of course it's guilty of copyright violation. But in the inputs\n",
            "[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.560]  or pre-training is something different. And what AI models do in pre-training is they take\n",
            "[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:23.040]  millions of text, millions of documents and they understand the positional relationship of the\n",
            "[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:30.000]  words and they translate that into into math into a vector space called positional encoding.\n",
            "[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.480]  That is a transformation of the underlying work. And in the same way that a human can read a body\n",
            "[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.800]  of works and then come up with their own point of view. That is basically what AI models are doing.\n",
            "[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.920]  So if AI models violates someone's copyright by outputting something that's identical, then obviously\n",
            "[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.560]  that's a violation. But if all they're doing is transforming the work, they're doing positional\n",
            "[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.040]  encoding and then coming up with their own unique work product, this judge said that that is not\n",
            "[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:00.160]  a violation of copyright. I completely agree with that. One other point, one other distinction\n",
            "[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.520]  of this judge made that things are very important is the difference between pirating and copyright.\n",
            "[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.240]  What the judge said is, look, you have to buy the book if you're going to basically do pre-training\n",
            "[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:15.120]  on it. You can't rip it off. That would be high-recie, but that's different than copyright.\n",
            "[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:19.440]  And so I agree with that too. Now, just one final point on this is-\n",
            "[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.880]  How would you, Sachs, on that point, how would you propose a large language model,\n",
            "[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.560]  take a million books and put it in, would they buy the physical books, scan them in if you-\n",
            "[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.760]  That's by the book. So what Anthropic did is they created this large repository of books.\n",
            "[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.440]  And unfortunately, some of them weren't paid for. They were pirated material.\n",
            "[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.200]  And so Anthropic is-\n",
            "[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.160]  Allegedly, by the way.\n",
            "[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.320]  Allegedly, isn't some hot water on. Then I think there is some case that's going to move forward\n",
            "[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:51.760]  about that. But the judge distinguished again between piracy and copyright. So the point is,\n",
            "[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.440]  when Anthropic should have done, apparently, is buy each copy of the book that they put in their\n",
            "[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.480]  repository. If they've done that-\n",
            "[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.440]  Scan them in.\n",
            "[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.640]  Scan them in. They wouldn't have had this piracy claim against them. But again, that is separate\n",
            "[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:10.800]  from copyright. Just one final point on this is I think it's very important that we end up with\n",
            "[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.160]  a sensible fair use definition, like the one the judges come up with in this Anthropic case.\n",
            "[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.400]  Because otherwise, we will lose the eye race to China. The fact of the matter is China's\n",
            "[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.920]  not going to care about American copyright policy. They are going to train on every scrap of\n",
            "[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.200]  data that's available to them on the internet. Apparently, they use a pirated book archive called\n",
            "[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:38.160]  LibGEN. And so, you know, they're not going to buy by copyright laws at all. And if we don't allow\n",
            "[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:45.040]  our AI models to again have a sensible fair use definition that allows them to train, but not\n",
            "[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.400]  violate an output, then we will lose to Chinese AI models because they'll have more data.\n",
            "[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.280]  And the fact is that the more data that you have, the better your AI model. So I do think it's\n",
            "[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:59.280]  very important for the US to consolidate around a fair use definition that makes sense.\n",
            "[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.680]  I'm not saying that this Anthropic case will be the final word. I think there will be other cases\n",
            "[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.080]  that come up with other definitions. There may be other judges that disagree. Ultimately,\n",
            "[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.600]  I think this is going into the stream court. But where we need to end up is with some sort of fair\n",
            "[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:18.560]  use definition that makes sense. Otherwise, we will lose the eye race to China. Your view, J.Kell.\n",
            "[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.640]  Yeah, obviously as a content creator, I'll take the other side of this. There is a nuance between\n",
            "[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.840]  training and there is a nuance between the output. I like to look at this as an opportunity. YouTube\n",
            "[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.120]  really did a great job with their content ID system of navigating this. Google has the most\n",
            "[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.560]  experience here with Google images and Google news. The one box where you get a little snippet\n",
            "[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:46.160]  up top. And the output is where this is really going to favor the content holders because these will\n",
            "[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:52.880]  be competitive products in the marketplace. The need to buy a New York Times subscription is no\n",
            "[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.160]  longer necessary. You can go on to a language model and ask them to give you wire cutter as one\n",
            "[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:04.720]  example. I like to cite what are their best picks for these air conditioners or microphones for\n",
            "[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.640]  podcasting and they will give it to you. And when they started doing that, that was my main reason\n",
            "[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.920]  to subscribe to the New York Times. And I no longer subscribe to it. I subscribe to Open Eye\n",
            "[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.720]  because they get the same information there. These cases will be very easy to win. And so I'm\n",
            "[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:21.680]  going to explain two things. One, how you can win this case is a content company. And then two,\n",
            "[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:29.520]  I'm going to give how the large language models can importantly win the AI race and actually not\n",
            "[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.880]  destroy the business on which they are built on. These language models have nothing without the\n",
            "[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:40.320]  content creators and the authors of these books of which I am one. They need us. And so they should\n",
            "[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.080]  want to pay us. They should want us to be compensated because that will keep us more competitive\n",
            "[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.120]  than China, which will just steal it one time. So here's how you win if you're a publisher.\n",
            "[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.880]  All you have to do is Disney, which is suing mid-jury right now for obvious copyright violations\n",
            "[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:04.960]  on the output in my interpretation. All you have to do is do a Marvel me. Make yourself into a Marvel\n",

            "[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:17.120]  and any author right now that pops up a website that says subscribe to the angel book and ask\n",
            "[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:23.680]  questions of it $10 for life, $1 per year, whatever it is, they will be able to prove damages\n",
            "[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.040]  very easily. And they will be able to prove that these language models are competitive. When they\n",
            "[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:36.960]  do that, then all of the output will need to be scrubbed or contained in some way. You can see\n",
            "[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:43.360]  this today. If you ask Chachi PT, which is the main targets, they're making $10 billion a year\n",

            "[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.040]  most money. They will not let you make certain images, copyrighted images, specifically the Disney\n",
            "[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:56.960]  ones. Go ahead and try. Go try to make a Darth Vader image and they will stop you. So they know\n",
            "[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.440]  they're doing it wrong and they've already put the controls in place. You need to show that this\n",
            "[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:07.600]  is your opportunity as a content creator. And now to my second point, SACs, which is the very easy,\n",
            "[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:12.240]  so that's how you can prove your case and win hands down versus all language models. Put a\n",
            "[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:18.160]  competitive product in the market you will win. Then the second piece that'll make this tenable is\n",

            "[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.600]  double their revenue and increase their investment. And then Chachi PT and the New York Times should\n",
            "[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.760]  do a deal. And I predict they will do this or with another language model that's smart enough to do\n",
            "[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.560]  it where when you go to Chachi PT and you do a search from the New York Times, you say, what does the\n",
            "[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:56.160]  New York Times say about Iran or what do they say about the wire cutters say about cameras? It should\n",
            "[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.040]  say authenticate with your New York Times subscription to have access to this. And on the New York Times\n",
            "[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.560]  website, they should say authenticate with Chachi PT. This would allow them to have a competitive\n",

            "[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.880]  advantage for the language models, just like cable channels might or Hulu might feature Disney\n",

            "[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.960]  you got to pay. If you want to perform it, you have to pay. So there is tons of precedent for it.\n",
